# EDA-on-Telecom-customer-churn-Analysis-
## Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a telecom customer dataset to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn.
The analysis explores how customer demographics, service usage, account information, and billing patterns influence the likelihood of customers leaving the company.

The dataset includes details such as:
Customer tenure and subscription history
Internet, phone, and additional service usage
Monthly and total charges
Contract type and payment method
Demographics: gender, senior citizen status, partner, dependents
Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)

Through visualizations and descriptive analysis, the project highlights:
Which customer groups churn the most
How service features impact churn
Relationships between customer behavior and churn rate
This EDA helps telecom companies design better strategies for customer retention, improve customer experience, and reduce churn.
