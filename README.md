# EDA-on-Telecom-customer-churn-Analysis-
## Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a telecom customer dataset to understand the major factors that lead to customer churn. The goal is to analyze how customer behavior, demographics, and service usage influence the likelihood of customers leaving the company.

### The dataset includes information on:

Customer tenure and subscription history
Internet, phone, and additional service usage
Monthly and total charges
Contract type and payment method
Demographics: gender, senior citizen status, partner, dependents
Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)

Through visual exploration and statistical analysis, the project identifies:

Customer groups with the highest churn rate
How service features and billing patterns impact churn
Key behavioral patterns linked to customer retention

This EDA provides insights that can help telecom companies improve customer retention strategies, enhance service quality, and reduce overall churn.
